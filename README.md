# Codecrafters Shell Challenge in Rust

This is my latest attempt at writing a simple shell in Rust, following Codecrafters.

## Usage

Just clone the repository and run `cargo run --release`.

## Progress

Rewritten based on [this user's](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/Elliot-Barnes) interesting [code](https://github.com/cc-code-examples/bright-moose-721880/blob/main/src/main.rs).

At the time of writing this, I'm not stuck anywhere.
